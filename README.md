Solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) challenges in C++, starting from 2022 backwards.

To get the puzzle output:
1) Clone the remote repository to a local directory
2) Run the following commands:  <br/>
    i) "g++ {year}/{day}_p{problem}.cpp" <br/>
    ii) "./a.exe < 2022/test{problem}.txt > output" <br/>
    ( {year} is 2022 as of now, {day} goes from 1 to 25 and {problem} is 1 or 2. Eg g++ 2022/12_p1.cpp and 2022/test12.txt)
